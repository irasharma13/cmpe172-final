Project introduction

We wanted a simple yet effective way to implement a photo application to AWS. We decided to incorporate Amazonâ€™s Rekognition technology as part of the core feature. Users can create an account with their email and continue to upload images to their album. When a user wants to retrieve a photo, they can search by context using AWS Rekognition technology. Users will have a simple and effective way to search images on the fly. 

Feauture list

The core features will include Account creation, Image upload, Image search, and Image delete. Image search should be utilizing Amazons Recognition capabilities. Tags of objects inside the image will be created by AWS Rekognition and the tags will be used to search associated images.
